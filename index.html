        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Zicong Yu and I am a Business Economics major. I want to pursue a career in Project Management as I am interested in dealing with different opportunities that are in need. I would like to work in the tech industrustry because I am a lot more familiar with technology than any other field. I grew up with a phone in my hand and I would like to put my already existing knowledge about technology into use. 

In my free time I like to play basketball and indulge in food. I like to go exploring for new food around my area. I am originally from Oakland California which is in the Bay area but I moved down to southern california where I go to school. I attend the university of california riverside where I study business economics. I chose this route and plan because I find the mathematical side of business to be very important. I want to be able to compare numbers within the company and industry to make sure the company I am working for is making the best use of our most valuable resource. 

I think business in general has pulled my interest and I have gravitated towards it because a lot of the older people I looked up to were business owners. I have wondered to myself multiple times throughout picking my career path if I wanted to do something related to business. I helped my friends kickstart their wholesaling business on amazon as well as learning much about starting an LLC. I think that having these background knowledge as someone in the field of business is crucial. Having these experiences alongside real professional business owners gave me a new perspective on those who are managing the business while I already have the experience of working for the business. At the end of the day, I am working for the business whether I am managing it or just being a ordinary worker for the project or product I am trying to promote to and sell. 

Besides the business aspects of my interest, I also have interest in the food and fitness industry. Growing up I have always been intrigued about fitness and health but I did not have the resources to learn more about it. I grew up in an asian household where I was not consciously thinking about what I put in my body. My family came from a background where food was a scarcity and anything my family could get was something positive and rewarding. I saw it as no different, I enjoyed everything that I ate but gave no thought into what nutrience I needed. Over quarantine, I found myself indulging on the internet about different health and fitness tips and tricks on how I can live a healthier life. I am glad to say that I have found a new hobby weightlifting. I would also like to go into the fitness industry as I know a lot of people struggle with this topic similar to the situation where I came from.
